# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Additional Config

I built this skeleton to jump right into the implementation of a project.

Commands I ran to config:

`npm i react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit typescript enzyme`
`npm i --save-dev @types/react @types/react-redux @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17 redux-mock-store`

I then reconfigured the tests via jest.config.js and configured the enzyme adapter in setupTests.js
